          Actor, writer, and gourmet, Vincent Leonard Price, Jr. was born in St
          Louis, Missouri, to Marguerite Cobb (Wilcox) and Vincent Leonard
          Price, Sr., president of the National Candy Company. He traveled
          through Europe, studied at Yale and became an actor. He made his
          screen debut in 1938, and after many minor roles, he began to perform
          in low-budget horror movies such as House of Wax (1953), achieving his
          first major success with House of Usher (1960).

          Known for his distinctive, low-pitched, creaky, atmospheric voice and
          his quizzical, mock-serious facial expressions, he went on to star in
          a series of acclaimed Gothic horror movies, such as Pit and the
          Pendulum (1961) and The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971).

          He abandoned films in the mid-1970s, going on to present cooking
          programs for television - he wrote "A Treasury of Great Recipes"
          (1965) with his second wife, Mary Grant - but had two final roles in
          The Whales of August (1987) and Edward Scissorhands (1990). He also
          recorded many Gothic horror short stories for the spoken-word label
          Caedmon Records. Vincent Price died at age 82 of lung cancer and
          emphysema on October 25, 1993. - IMDb Mini Biography By:
